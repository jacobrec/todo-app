# Calendar
The Calendar section allows you to add events to a traditional calendar view to ensure you never miss a date. Events are the main feature here. Days on the calendar on with an event are marked by being a darker tone of gray.

Upon clicking on one of these dates it will open up the schedule view. Here you can see everything going on this month, to add additional functionality and avoid repeating features, this schedule view actually displays them in the order of most recently added last so the oldest event shows at the top to ensure everything is fresh in your mind. As well you have the option to remove events with ease with one tap by just clicking the event.

To create a new event, just hit the big red plus button in the calendar view. Upon clicking you will be taken to an event entering window. Since the purpose of a calendar is to help you remember events, we've designed it to ensure optimal memory recall, you must enter the event date in a precise format of YYYY-MM-DD to force you to think about the date even longer. In this same view, you will also see inputs for the event name and location.
