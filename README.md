# TodoApp Help Manual
Created by Kyle Hennig and Jacob Reckhard

## Running the app
Double click on TodoApp.exe to start the program. A new window will pop up showing a main menu with 4 options.
- Notes
- Todo List
- Calendar
- Clock

Click on the option that you wish to use. At any time, you will be able to change your decision using the menu on the left side hand of the page. By default, this menu is minimized for your viewing convenience. You can show the menu by clicking on the hamburger icon (&#9776;) located in the top left corner of the app.

## Notes
On this page, you can create, edit, and delete any and every thought that comes to your mind.
<br>
<br>
Begin by typing whatever you wish to record into the box that says "Type some text here..." and click on "Create Note" when you are done. A note will appear. This note will be saved to your hard drive, and will be available even if you close and reopen TodoApp.
<br>
<br>
The edit icon (a picture of a pencil) allows you to change the text of your note at a later date if you so choose to. Clicking it will allow you to edit the text of the note, and will change the button to a save button. Once you are done, click the save button to finalize your changes.
<br>
<br>
The delete icon (a garbage can) will delete your note. Only click this button if you are sure that you wish to erase it permanently.

## Todo List
The todo list allows you to create a list of tasks (called todos) that you intend to complete in the near future. Similar to how notes function, you can create a todo by typing it into the input box on the bottom of the page and clicking "Create Todo" when you are done.
<br>
<br>
Todos have a checkbox which allows you to mark which todos have been completed. Whether or not this checkbox is checked will also be saved to your hard drive, in addition to the description of the todo and the date it was creation.
<br>
<br>
A todo item also has an edit and delete button as well, which functions the same as in the notes section of the app.

## Clock
Our clock tells you the time down to the exact second, rendered as a analog clock with an hour, minute, and second hand. Two options are shown below the clock:
- Timer
- Stopwatch

Clicking on "Timer" brings you to the timer page. Here, you can type in an amount of time. Hours go in the first box, minutes go in the next box, and seconds go in the last box. Press start, and the timer will begin counting down. An audible alert will be heard and a push notification will be send to your notification center when this timer reaches zero.
<br>
<br>
Clicking on "Stopwatch" opens the stopwatch page. Here, you can click the start button to begin timing yourself. The timer will count up until you decide to click the stop button.

# Calendar
The Calendar section allows you to add events to a traditional calendar view to ensure you never miss a date. Events are the main feature here. Days on the calendar on with an event are marked by being a darker tone of gray.

Upon clicking on one of these dates it will open up the schedule view. Here you can see everything going on this month, to add additional functionality and avoid repeating features, this schedule view actually displays them in the order of most recently added last so the oldest event shows at the top to ensure everything is fresh in your mind. As well you have the option to remove events with ease with one tap by just clicking the event.

To create a new event, just hit the big red plus button in the calendar view. Upon clicking you will be taken to an event entering window. Since the purpose of a calendar is to help you remember events, we've designed it to ensure optimal memory recall, you must enter the event date in a precise format of YYYY-MM-DD to force you to think about the date even longer. In this same view, you will also see inputs for the event name and location.
